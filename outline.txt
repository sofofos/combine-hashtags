CASE 1:
# Use regex to match the json data and write it into a file for easier reading
# CLI: search_script $hashtag1 $hashtag2
  - search keywords hardcoded for now based on downloaded files
  - as such, FIle.open($hashtag1), read and JSON.parse
  - search every caption for text containing $hashtag2
  - for each result, instantiate a Post object with parameters: url, caption
    JSON.entry_data.TagPage[0].data.recent.sections[3].layout_content.medias[0].media.caption

CASE 2:

Write a gem based on querying the basic API (ie own profile)
As a user I can...
  search for my posts containing a combination of hashtags
  see what hashtags I use most
  get suggestions for hashtags that appear with other hashtags
  get a link to each post matching my search

TODO's:
  - Store API credentials securely and set as environment variables - DONE
  - Write bash/zsh script for setting env vars by user?  - DONE
  - Write the Post class w/ attributes img_url, post_url, caption, tags
  - Refactor the query script properly (env vars + get next pagination)
  - Write the interface (CLI first, UI after)
  -
